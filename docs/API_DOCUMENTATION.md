## Introduction

The SaveLife.com API provides comprehensive access to the platform's AI-powered medical crowdfunding capabilities. This RESTful API enables developers to integrate SaveLife.com functionality into their applications, build custom interfaces, and create automated workflows for campaign management, donation processing, and user engagement.

The API is designed with modern web standards, utilizing JSON for data exchange, HTTP status codes for response indication, and OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication. All API endpoints support HTTPS encryption and implement comprehensive input validation and output sanitization.

### Base URL

The API base URL varies by environment:

- **Production:** `https://api.savelife.com/v1`
- **Staging:** `https://staging-api.savelife.com/v1`
- **Development:** `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`

### API Versioning

The SaveLife.com API uses URL-based versioning to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions between API versions. The current version is `v1`, and all endpoints are prefixed with `/v1/`.

### Content Types

The API accepts and returns JSON data with the following content types:

- **Request Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Response Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **File Upload Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`

## Authentication

The SaveLife.com API uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens for secure authentication and authorization. This section provides detailed information about authentication flows, token management, and security considerations.

### OAuth 2.0 Flows

The API supports multiple OAuth 2.0 flows to accommodate different application types and security requirements:

#### Authorization Code Flow

The authorization code flow is recommended for web applications and mobile apps that can securely store client secrets. This flow provides the highest level of security by keeping sensitive credentials on the server side.

**Step 1: Authorization Request**

Redirect users to the authorization endpoint:

```
GET https://api.savelife.com/oauth/authorize?
  response_type=code&
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
  redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
  scope=campaigns:read campaigns:write donations:read&
  state=RANDOM_STATE_VALUE
```

**Step 2: Authorization Code Exchange**

Exchange the authorization code for access tokens:

```http
POST /oauth/token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "grant_type": "authorization_code",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "code": "AUTHORIZATION_CODE",
  "redirect_uri": "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "campaigns:read campaigns:write donations:read"
}
```

#### Client Credentials Flow

The client credentials flow is suitable for server-to-server communication where no user interaction is required.

```http
POST /oauth/token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "scope": "campaigns:read analytics:read"
}
```

### Token Usage

Include the access token in the Authorization header for all API requests:

```http
GET /campaigns
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Token Refresh

Access tokens have a limited lifetime (typically 1 hour). Use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens without requiring user re-authentication:

```http
POST /oauth/token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "grant_type": "refresh_token",
  "refresh_token": "REFRESH_TOKEN",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

### Scopes

API access is controlled through scopes that define the permissions granted to applications:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `campaigns:read` | Read access to campaign information |
| `campaigns:write` | Create and update campaigns |
| `campaigns:delete` | Delete campaigns |

## Error Handling

The SaveLife.com API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests. Error responses include detailed information to help developers understand and resolve issues quickly.

### HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | OK - Request succeeded |
| 201 | Created - Resource created successfully |
| 204 | No Content - Request succeeded with no response body |
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid request parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Authentication required |
| 403 | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| 404 | Not Found - Resource not found |
| 409 | Conflict - Resource conflict |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity - Validation errors |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error - Server error |
| 503 | Service Unavailable - Service temporarily unavailable |

### Error Response Format

All error responses follow a consistent format that includes error codes, messages, and additional context:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "The request contains invalid parameters",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "code": "invalid_format",
        "message": "Email address format is invalid"
      },
      {
        "field": "amount",
        "code": "minimum_value",
        "message": "Donation amount must be at least $5"
      }
    ],
    "request_id": "req_1234567890",
    "timestamp": "2024-02-21T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Error Code | Description | Resolution |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `authentication_required` | Valid authentication token required | Include valid Bearer token in Authorization header |
| `insufficient_permissions` | User lacks required permissions | Ensure user has appropriate scopes and roles |
| `validation_error` | Request parameters failed validation | Check field-specific error details and correct parameters |
| `resource_not_found` | Requested resource does not exist | Verify resource ID and user access permissions |
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests in time window | Implement exponential backoff and retry logic |
| `payment_failed` | Payment processing failed | Check payment method details and try again |
| `campaign_not_active` | Campaign is not accepting donations | Verify campaign status and end date |
| `insufficient_funds` | Payout amount exceeds available balance | Check campaign balance and adjust payout amount |

## Rate Limiting

The SaveLife.com API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain service quality for all users. Rate limits vary by endpoint type and user authentication status.

### Rate Limit Headers

All API responses include rate limit information in the response headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
X-RateLimit-Window: 3600
```

### Rate Limit Tiers

| User Type | Requests per Hour | Burst Limit |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Unauthenticated | 100 | 10 |
| Authenticated User | 1,000 | 50 |
| Verified User | 5,000 | 100 |
| Premium Partner | 10,000 | 200 |

### Handling Rate Limits

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns a 429 status code with retry information:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after the specified time.",
    "retry_after": 3600,
    "limit": 1000,
    "window": 3600
  }
}
```

Implement exponential backoff when handling rate limit errors:

```javascript
async function makeAPIRequest(url, options, retryCount = 0) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);
    
    if (response.status === 429) {
      const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After') || Math.pow(2, retryCount);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter * 1000));
      return makeAPIRequest(url, options, retryCount + 1);
    }
    
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Examples

This section provides comprehensive examples of common API usage patterns and integration scenarios to help developers implement SaveLife.com functionality effectively.

### Complete Campaign Creation Flow

This example demonstrates the complete process of creating a campaign with AI optimization, document verification, and initial setup.

```javascript
const SaveLife = require('@savelife/api-sdk');

async function createOptimizedCampaign() {
  const client = new SaveLife({
    apiKey: process.env.SAVELIFE_API_KEY,
    environment: 'production'
  });

  try {
    // Step 1: Get AI-optimized title suggestions
    const titleSuggestions = await client.ai.campaign.generateTitle({
      medicalCondition: 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia',
      treatmentType: 'Bone Marrow Transplant',
      patientAge: 8,
      urgencyLevel: 'high',
      targetAmount: 150000
    });

    const bestTitle = titleSuggestions.suggestions[0].title;

    // Step 2: Optimize campaign story
    const storyOptimization = await client.ai.campaign.optimizeStory({
      storyText: 'My daughter Emma was diagnosed with leukemia...',
      medicalCondition: 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia',
      patientDemographics: {
        age: 8,
        gender: 'female',
        location: 'Denver, CO'
      },

        type: 'Bone Marrow Transplant',
        estimatedCost: 150000,
        urgency: 'high'
      }
    });

    // Step 3: Create the campaign
    const campaign = await client.campaigns.create({
      title: bestTitle,
      story: storyOptimization.optimizedStory.introduction + '\n\n' +
             storyOptimization.optimizedStory.medicalDetails + '\n\n' +
