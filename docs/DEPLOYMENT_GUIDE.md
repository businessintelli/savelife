Each section includes practical examples, configuration templates, and troubleshooting guidance to ensure successful implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the deployment process, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements and that all necessary tools and accounts are properly configured. The prerequisites are organized by category to facilitate systematic preparation.

### System Requirements

The deployment process requires a development machine or CI/CD environment with sufficient resources to build and deploy the application components. The minimum system requirements include a modern operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL), at least 8GB of RAM, 50GB of available disk space, and a stable internet connection with sufficient bandwidth for uploading container images and deploying resources.

For production deployments, the cloud infrastructure requirements vary by provider but generally include compute instances with at least 2 vCPUs and 4GB of RAM for the application servers, managed database services with appropriate performance tiers, and load balancers configured for high availability. The specific resource requirements are detailed in each cloud provider section.

### Required Accounts and Credentials

Successful deployment requires active accounts with the target cloud providers, each configured with appropriate permissions and billing arrangements. For AWS deployments, you need an AWS account with programmatic access credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) and permissions to create and manage EC2 instances, ECS services, RDS databases, S3 buckets, and CloudFormation stacks.

Google Cloud Platform deployments require a GCP project with billing enabled, a service account with appropriate IAM roles including Compute Admin, Cloud SQL Admin, and Cloud Run Admin, and the service account key file downloaded for authentication. The GCP project should have the necessary APIs enabled, including Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Cloud Run, and Container Registry.

Azure deployments need an Azure subscription with an active service principal configured with Contributor role permissions, and the necessary resource providers registered including Microsoft.Compute, Microsoft.ContainerInstance, and Microsoft.Sql. Additionally, you should have Azure Container Registry access for storing and managing container images.

### Development Tools and Software

The deployment process relies on several key tools that must be installed and configured on your development machine or CI/CD environment. Docker is essential for containerizing the application components and must be installed with the ability to build multi-platform images. The Docker version should be 20.10 or later to ensure compatibility with all features used in the deployment process.

Node.js version 18 or later is required for building the frontend React application, along with the pnpm package manager for efficient dependency management. Python 3.11 is necessary for the backend Flask application, with pip and virtual environment support for managing Python dependencies.

The cloud provider CLI tools are crucial for deployment automation and management. Install the AWS CLI version 2, Google Cloud SDK with the gcloud command-line tool, and Azure CLI. Each tool should be configured with appropriate credentials and default regions or projects.

Git is required for version control and CI/CD integration, with the GitHub CLI (gh) recommended for triggering workflows and managing repository settings. Additional tools include kubectl for Kubernetes management (if using managed Kubernetes services), Terraform for infrastructure as code (optional but recommended for advanced deployments), and jq for JSON processing in shell scripts.

### Network and Security Configuration

Proper network configuration is essential for secure and reliable deployments. Ensure that your development environment can access the internet without restrictive firewalls that might block container registry access or cloud API calls. If deploying from a corporate environment, verify that the necessary domains and ports are whitelisted for cloud provider APIs and container registries.

Security configuration includes setting up secure credential storage and access patterns. Use environment variables or secure credential management systems rather than hardcoding sensitive information in configuration files. Configure multi-factor authentication for all cloud provider accounts and use least-privilege access principles when creating service accounts and IAM roles.

For production deployments, plan the network architecture including VPC configuration, subnet design, security group rules, and load balancer setup. Consider implementing network segmentation to isolate different tiers of the application and ensure that database access is restricted to application servers only.

## Local Development Setup

The local development environment provides a complete, self-contained instance of the SaveLife.com platform that enables developers to build, test, and debug the application before deploying to cloud environments. This section provides detailed instructions for setting up a fully functional development environment that mirrors the production architecture while remaining lightweight and easy to manage.

### Automated Setup Process

The SaveLife.com repository includes an automated setup script that streamlines the process of configuring a local development environment. The script, located at `scripts/local-setup.sh`, performs comprehensive environment preparation including dependency installation, repository cloning, environment configuration, and service initialization.

To begin the setup process, clone the SaveLife.com repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/savelife.git`. Navigate to the cloned repository directory and execute the setup script with `./scripts/local-setup.sh`. The script will prompt for confirmation before making system changes and will provide detailed progress information throughout the installation process.

The automated setup process includes several key phases. First, it detects your operating system and installs appropriate dependencies using the system package manager. For Linux systems, it uses apt-get to install required packages, while macOS systems use Homebrew. The script then installs Docker and Docker Compose for containerized service management, Node.js and pnpm for frontend development, and Python with virtual environment support for backend development.

Following dependency installation, the script configures the project structure by creating necessary directories, setting up environment files with default values, and initializing the database schema. It also installs project-specific dependencies for both frontend and backend components, ensuring that all required packages are available for development.

### Manual Setup Process

For developers who prefer manual configuration or need to customize the setup process, detailed manual installation instructions are provided. Begin by ensuring that all prerequisite software is installed, including Docker, Node.js 18+, Python 3.11, and the necessary cloud CLI tools.

Clone the repository and navigate to the project root directory. Create the frontend environment file at `frontend/.env.local` with the following configuration:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_key_here
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID
REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
```

Create the backend environment file at `backend/.env` with appropriate configuration values:

```
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://savelife:password@localhost:5432/savelife_dev
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
```

Install frontend dependencies by navigating to the `frontend` directory and running `pnpm install`. For the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory, create a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv`, activate it using `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows), and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Database and Service Configuration

The local development environment uses Docker Compose to manage supporting services including PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for caching and session management. The `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root defines these services with appropriate configuration for development use.

Start the supporting services using `docker-compose up -d postgres redis`. This command starts the database and cache services in the background, making them available for the application. The PostgreSQL service is configured with a development database named `savelife_dev`, accessible with the username `savelife` and password `password`.

Initialize the database schema by navigating to the `backend` directory, activating the Python virtual environment, and running the database initialization script. The Flask application includes database migration capabilities that automatically create the necessary tables and initial data for development.

Verify that the services are running correctly by checking the Docker container status with `docker-compose ps`. Both the PostgreSQL and Redis containers should show as "Up" status. You can also test database connectivity using `pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432 -U savelife` and Redis connectivity using `redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 ping`.

### Development Workflow

The local development environment supports hot reloading for both frontend and backend components, enabling rapid development and testing cycles. The frontend React application uses Vite for fast development builds and hot module replacement, while the backend Flask application runs in debug mode with automatic reloading when source files change.

Start the development environment using the provided workflow script: `./scripts/dev-workflow.sh start`. This command starts both the frontend and backend development servers, along with the supporting Docker services. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API at `http://localhost:5000`.

The development workflow includes several useful commands for common tasks. Run tests using `./scripts/dev-workflow.sh test`, which executes both frontend and backend test suites. Build the application for production testing with `./scripts/dev-workflow.sh build`. Check the status of all services using `./scripts/dev-workflow.sh status`.

For debugging purposes, the development environment includes comprehensive logging and error reporting. Frontend errors are displayed in the browser console and development server output, while backend errors are logged to the console with detailed stack traces. The Flask application is configured with debug mode enabled, providing detailed error pages for development.

### IDE Configuration

The repository includes pre-configured settings for popular integrated development environments, particularly Visual Studio Code. The `.vscode` directory contains workspace settings, launch configurations for debugging, and task definitions for common development operations.

The VS Code configuration includes Python interpreter settings that automatically use the backend virtual environment, TypeScript configuration for the React frontend, and Docker integration for container management. Launch configurations are provided for debugging both the Flask backend and React frontend applications.

Recommended VS Code extensions include the Python extension for backend development, the TypeScript and React extensions for frontend development, the Docker extension for container management, and cloud provider extensions for AWS, GCP, and Azure integration. The workspace settings automatically configure these extensions with appropriate project-specific settings.

For developers using other IDEs, the project structure and configuration files are designed to be IDE-agnostic. The Python backend uses standard virtual environment practices, the React frontend follows conventional project structure, and all configuration is externalized to environment files and standard configuration formats.




## Cloud Infrastructure Overview

The SaveLife.com platform is architected for multi-cloud deployment, leveraging the strengths of different cloud providers while maintaining consistency in application behavior and operational procedures. This section provides an overview of the cloud infrastructure design principles, service mapping across providers, and the rationale behind the multi-cloud approach.

### Architecture Principles

The cloud infrastructure design follows several key principles that ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability across all deployment environments. The microservices architecture separates the frontend React application from the backend Flask API, enabling independent scaling and deployment of each component. This separation also facilitates the use of different cloud services optimized for each workload type.

Containerization using Docker provides consistency across development, staging, and production environments while enabling portability between cloud providers. All application components are packaged as container images that can be deployed to various container orchestration platforms including Amazon ECS, Google Cloud Run, and Azure Container Instances.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles are implemented using cloud-native tools such as AWS CloudFormation, Google Cloud Deployment Manager, and Azure Resource Manager templates. This approach ensures reproducible deployments, version control of infrastructure changes, and automated provisioning of cloud resources.

The platform implements a stateless application design where all persistent data is stored in managed database services, and session information is maintained in distributed cache systems. This design enables horizontal scaling and simplifies disaster recovery procedures.

### Service Mapping Across Cloud Providers

Each cloud provider offers equivalent services for the core infrastructure components required by the SaveLife.com platform. The following table illustrates the service mapping across AWS, GCP, and Azure:

| Component | AWS | GCP | Azure |
|-----------|-----|-----|-------|
| Container Hosting | ECS Fargate | Cloud Run | Container Instances |
| Database | RDS PostgreSQL | Cloud SQL PostgreSQL | Database for PostgreSQL |
| Cache | ElastiCache Redis | Memorystore Redis | Cache for Redis |
| Load Balancer | Application Load Balancer | Cloud Load Balancing | Application Gateway |
| Container Registry | ECR | Artifact Registry | Container Registry |
| Secret Management | Secrets Manager | Secret Manager | Key Vault |
| Monitoring | CloudWatch | Cloud Monitoring | Azure Monitor |
| Logging | CloudWatch Logs | Cloud Logging | Log Analytics |
| CDN | CloudFront | Cloud CDN | CDN |
| DNS | Route 53 | Cloud DNS | DNS Zone |

This service mapping enables consistent functionality across all cloud providers while allowing for provider-specific optimizations and cost considerations. The application code remains unchanged regardless of the deployment target, with only infrastructure configuration varying between providers.

### Network Architecture

The network architecture implements security best practices including network segmentation, private subnets for database services, and controlled ingress and egress traffic. Each cloud deployment creates a virtual private cloud (VPC) or equivalent network isolation boundary that contains all platform resources.

Public subnets host load balancers and NAT gateways that provide controlled internet access, while private subnets contain application servers and database instances. This design ensures that sensitive data and application logic are not directly accessible from the internet while maintaining necessary connectivity for application functionality.

Security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) implement defense-in-depth principles by restricting traffic to only necessary ports and protocols. Database access is limited to application servers within the same VPC, and administrative access is controlled through bastion hosts or cloud-native management interfaces.

### Data Architecture

The data architecture emphasizes security, compliance, and performance while maintaining consistency across cloud providers. PostgreSQL serves as the primary database for all transactional data, with automated backups and point-in-time recovery capabilities enabled across all environments.

Redis provides caching and session management capabilities, improving application performance and enabling stateless application design. The cache layer is configured with appropriate persistence settings to balance performance and data durability requirements.

File storage for user uploads and application assets utilizes cloud-native object storage services (S3, Cloud Storage, Blob Storage) with appropriate access controls and encryption settings. Content delivery networks (CDNs) provide global distribution of static assets to improve user experience.

Data encryption is implemented at multiple layers including encryption at rest for databases and file storage, encryption in transit for all network communications, and application-level encryption for sensitive data fields. Key management utilizes cloud-native services to ensure secure key storage and rotation.

## AWS Deployment
