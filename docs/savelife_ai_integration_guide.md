};
```

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Unit Testing

Each AI service includes comprehensive unit tests that validate core functionality:

```python
# Example test for Campaign AI
def test_campaign_suggestions():
    ai = CampaignAI()
    test_data = {
        'name': 'Test Patient',
        'medical_condition': 'cancer requiring chemotherapy',
        'treatment_plan': 'chemotherapy and surgery',
        'insurance_status': 'limited coverage'
    }
    
    suggestions = ai.generate_campaign_suggestions(test_data)
    
    assert suggestions.title is not None
    assert suggestions.goal_amount > 0
    assert suggestions.confidence_score >= 0 and suggestions.confidence_score <= 1
    assert len(suggestions.keywords) > 0
```

### Integration Testing

API endpoints are tested for proper request/response handling:

```python
# Example API test
def test_campaign_suggestions_endpoint():
    response = client.post('/api/ai/campaign/suggestions', json={
        'name': 'Test Patient',
        'medical_condition': 'test condition'
    })
    
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.get_json()
    assert 'title' in data
    assert 'goal_amount' in data
    assert 'confidence_score' in data
```

### Performance Testing

AI services are optimized for response times under 2 seconds for most operations:

- Campaign suggestions: < 1 second
- Document analysis: < 2 seconds
- Donor matching: < 3 seconds for 100+ campaigns
- Verification workflows: < 5 seconds for complete analysis

### Security Testing

All AI services implement security best practices:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure handling of sensitive medical data
- HIPAA compliance for document processing
- Fraud detection and prevention

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables

```bash
# AI Service Configuration
AI_MODEL_CACHE_SIZE=1000
AI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30
AI_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=100

# Security Configuration
AI_API_KEY_REQUIRED=true
AI_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60

# Performance Configuration
AI_ENABLE_CACHING=true
AI_CACHE_TTL=3600
```

### Scaling Recommendations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple AI service instances behind a load balancer
2. **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently requested AI operations
3. **Async Processing**: Use Celery for long-running verification tasks
4. **Model Optimization**: Optimize AI models for production performance

### Monitoring and Logging

```python
# Example monitoring integration
import logging
from datetime import datetime

logger = logging.getLogger('savelife_ai')

def log_ai_request(service, endpoint, duration, success):
    logger.info(f"AI Request: {service}.{endpoint} - {duration}ms - {'SUCCESS' if success else 'FAILED'}")

# Usage in AI services
start_time = datetime.now()
try:
    result = ai_service.process_request(data)
    log_ai_request('campaign_ai', 'suggestions', 
                  (datetime.now() - start_time).total_seconds() * 1000, True)
except Exception as e:
    log_ai_request('campaign_ai', 'suggestions', 
                  (datetime.now() - start_time).total_seconds() * 1000, False)
    raise
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Error Handling

Always implement proper error handling for AI service calls:

```javascript
const handleAIRequest = async (apiCall) => {
  try {
    const result = await apiCall();
    return { success: true, data: result };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('AI Service Error:', error);
    return { 
      success: false, 
      error: 'AI service temporarily unavailable. Please try again.' 
    };
  }
};
```

### 2. User Experience

- Provide loading indicators for AI operations
- Show confidence scores to users when appropriate
- Allow users to override AI suggestions
- Provide clear explanations for AI recommendations
