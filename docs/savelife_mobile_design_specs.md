Update distribution includes both automatic updates for minor improvements and user-controlled updates for major feature releases. The strategy balances keeping users current with respecting user preferences and device constraints.

Beta testing programs provide early access to new features for engaged users while gathering feedback and identifying issues before general release. The program includes clear communication channels and feedback collection systems that enable rapid iteration and improvement.
