## Getting Started

### Creating Your Account

Creating an account on SaveLife.com is the first step toward either starting a fundraising campaign or beginning your journey as a donor. Our registration process is designed to be simple and secure while collecting the information necessary to provide you with personalized features and maintain platform security.

To create your account, visit the SaveLife.com homepage and click the "Sign Up" button in the top navigation bar. You will be presented with a registration form that asks for basic information including your first and last name, email address, and a secure password. We recommend using a strong password that includes a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to protect your account.

During registration, you will also have the option to specify your primary interest in the platform, whether you are planning to create a campaign, donate to campaigns, or both. This information helps us customize your experience and provide relevant recommendations and guidance. You can always change these preferences later in your account settings.

After completing the registration form, you will receive a verification email at the address you provided. Click the verification link in this email to activate your account and confirm your email address. Email verification is an important security measure that helps protect your account and ensures you receive important notifications about your campaigns or donations.

Once your account is verified, you can log in to the platform and begin exploring features. Your account dashboard provides access to all platform functionality including campaign creation tools, donation history, account settings, and support resources. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the interface and explore the various features available to you.

### Account Security and Privacy

Account security is a top priority at SaveLife.com, especially given the sensitive nature of medical information and financial transactions involved in healthcare fundraising. We implement multiple layers of security to protect your account and personal information, but there are also steps you can take to enhance your account security.

We strongly recommend enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account, which adds an extra layer of security beyond your password. With 2FA enabled, you will need to provide a verification code from your mobile device in addition to your password when logging in. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

Your privacy is equally important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information in accordance with applicable privacy laws including HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA. Our privacy policy explains in detail how we collect, use, and protect your information, and you have control over many aspects of your privacy settings through your account preferences.

You can review and update your privacy settings at any time through your account dashboard. These settings control how your information is used for platform features like donor matching, what information is visible to other users, and how you receive communications from the platform. We encourage you to review these settings and adjust them according to your preferences.

If you ever have concerns about account security or privacy, our support team is available to help. You can contact us through the platform's support system, and we will respond promptly to address any issues or questions you may have about protecting your account and personal information.

## Creating a Campaign

### Getting Started with Campaign Creation

Creating a successful fundraising campaign on SaveLife.com begins with understanding your story and gathering the necessary information and documentation. Our AI-powered campaign creation tools will guide you through the process, but preparation beforehand will help you create a more compelling and effective campaign.

Before you begin, gather relevant medical documentation including diagnosis reports, treatment plans, insurance information, and cost estimates from healthcare providers. Having this information readily available will make the campaign creation process smoother and help our AI systems provide more accurate recommendations for your campaign goals and messaging.

Think about your story and what you want potential donors to understand about your situation. Consider the medical condition or treatment need, how it has impacted your life or your family's life, what specific treatments or expenses you need help with, and what the funds will accomplish. Our AI writing assistant will help you craft your message, but having a clear understanding of your story will make the process more effective.

To begin creating your campaign, log in to your SaveLife.com account and click the "Start Campaign" button on your dashboard or in the main navigation. This will launch our guided campaign creation process, which uses artificial intelligence to help you create the most effective campaign possible while ensuring all necessary information is included.

The campaign creation process is divided into several steps that build upon each other to create a comprehensive and compelling fundraising campaign. Each step includes AI-powered assistance and recommendations based on successful campaigns with similar characteristics. You can save your progress at any time and return to complete your campaign later if needed.

### Step 1: Basic Information and AI Assistance

The first step in creating your campaign involves providing basic information about the patient and medical situation. This information is used by our AI systems to generate personalized recommendations for your campaign title, funding goal, and story structure.

Begin by entering the patient's name and your relationship to the patient if you are creating a campaign on behalf of someone else. Our platform supports campaigns created by patients themselves as well as campaigns created by family members, friends, or authorized representatives. Clear identification of the patient and campaign creator helps build trust with potential donors.

Next, provide a detailed description of the medical condition or treatment need. Be as specific as possible about the diagnosis, treatment requirements, timeline, and any other relevant medical information. Our AI systems analyze this information to understand the complexity and urgency of the situation, which helps generate more accurate recommendations.

Include information about current insurance coverage and what expenses are not covered. This helps our AI calculate realistic funding goals and helps potential donors understand exactly what their contributions will support. Be honest about insurance limitations, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums that contribute to your funding need.

As you enter this information, our AI assistant provides real-time suggestions and feedback. You may see recommendations for additional information to include, suggestions for how to phrase certain aspects of your situation, or questions that help clarify important details. These suggestions are based on analysis of successful campaigns and are designed to help you create the most effective campaign possible.

Once you have provided the basic information, click the "Get AI Suggestions" button to generate personalized recommendations for your campaign. Our AI will analyze your information and provide suggestions for campaign titles, funding goals, story frameworks, and relevant keywords that can help your campaign reach the right audience.

### Step 2: Campaign Title and Goal Setting

Your campaign title is one of the most important elements of your fundraising effort, as it is often the first thing potential donors see when browsing campaigns. A compelling title should be clear, specific, and emotionally engaging while accurately representing your situation and funding need.

Our AI title generator analyzes your medical situation and creates multiple title options that balance clarity with emotional appeal. The suggestions consider factors like the patient's name, medical condition, treatment type, and urgency level to create titles that resonate with potential donors while remaining respectful and appropriate.

Review the AI-generated title suggestions and select the one that best represents your situation and feels authentic to your story. You can also modify any of the suggestions or create your own title if none of the suggestions feel quite right. The most effective titles are typically between 50-80 characters and include the patient's name and specific medical need.

Setting an appropriate funding goal is crucial for campaign success. Goals that are too low may not cover all necessary expenses, while goals that are too high may seem unrealistic to potential donors. Our AI goal recommendation system analyzes your medical situation, treatment costs, insurance coverage, and similar successful campaigns to suggest an optimal funding target.

The AI considers factors including the complexity of the medical condition, typical treatment costs for similar conditions, your insurance coverage and out-of-pocket maximums, additional expenses like travel and accommodation for treatment, and lost income during treatment and recovery. This comprehensive analysis helps ensure your goal is both realistic and sufficient to meet your needs.

You can accept the AI recommendation, adjust it based on additional information you may have, or set your own goal if you prefer. Remember that you can always adjust your goal later if circumstances change or if you discover additional expenses that need to be covered.

### Step 3: Crafting Your Campaign Story

Your campaign story is the heart of your fundraising effort and the primary way you connect with potential donors on an emotional level. A compelling story helps donors understand not just what you need, but why their support matters and how it will make a difference in your life or the life of your loved one.

Our AI story assistant helps you structure your narrative in a way that is both emotionally engaging and informative. The assistant provides a framework that includes key elements successful campaigns typically include: an introduction to the patient and their situation, explanation of the medical condition and its impact, description of the treatment plan and associated costs, and a clear call to action for potential donors.

Begin by introducing the patient and providing context about their life before the medical crisis. This helps donors connect with the person behind the campaign and understand what is at stake. Include information about family, work, hobbies, or other aspects of life that help paint a picture of who the patient is as a person.

Explain the medical condition in terms that non-medical people can understand. While it is important to be accurate about the diagnosis and treatment requirements, avoid excessive medical jargon that might confuse or overwhelm potential donors. Our AI assistant can help you translate complex medical information into clear, accessible language.

Describe how the medical condition has impacted the patient's life and the lives of family members. This might include physical symptoms, emotional challenges, financial strain, or disruptions to work, school, or family life. Honest and specific details help donors understand the full scope of the situation and the urgency of the need for support.

Explain the treatment plan and why it is necessary. Include information about what the treatment involves, where it will take place, how long it will take, and what the expected outcomes are. If there are multiple treatment options, explain why the chosen approach is the best option and what makes it necessary or urgent.

Detail the financial aspects of the treatment including total costs, what insurance covers, what out-of-pocket expenses are expected, and any additional costs like travel, accommodation, or lost income. Be specific about how donated funds will be used and what impact different donation levels will have on the patient's ability to receive treatment.

As you write your story, the AI assistant provides real-time feedback and suggestions. This might include recommendations for additional information to include, suggestions for improving clarity or emotional impact, or warnings about potential issues that could affect campaign success. Use this feedback to refine your story and make it as compelling as possible.

### Step 4: Document Upload and Verification

Document verification is a crucial component of building trust with potential donors and ensuring the integrity of the SaveLife.com platform. Our AI-powered verification system analyzes uploaded documents to confirm the authenticity of medical claims and provide donors with confidence that their contributions are supporting legitimate medical needs.

The types of documents that strengthen your campaign include medical records and diagnosis reports, treatment plans and cost estimates, insurance documentation showing coverage limitations, hospital bills or cost estimates, and letters from healthcare providers. While not all of these documents are required, providing comprehensive documentation significantly improves donor confidence and campaign success rates.

Our document upload system accepts common file formats including PDF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF. Documents should be clear and legible, with all relevant information visible. If you have physical documents, you can use your smartphone camera or a scanner to create digital copies for upload. Our system can process documents in multiple languages, though English documents typically process faster.

As you upload each document, our AI verification system analyzes the content to extract relevant information and assess authenticity. The system looks for consistency between documents, appropriate medical terminology and formatting, valid healthcare provider information, and realistic cost estimates based on typical treatment costs.

The verification process typically takes a few minutes per document, and you will receive real-time feedback about the verification status. Documents that pass initial AI verification receive a "Verified" badge that is displayed to potential donors. Documents that require additional review are flagged for human verification, which may take 24-48 hours.

If any documents are flagged for additional review, do not be concerned. This is a normal part of our thorough verification process and does not necessarily indicate any problems with your campaign. Our human verification team will review flagged documents and contact you if additional information or clarification is needed.

You can continue with campaign creation while document verification is in progress. However, campaigns with verified documentation typically perform better and receive more donations, so we recommend completing the verification process before actively promoting your campaign.

### Step 5: Campaign Review and Publishing

Before publishing your campaign, take time to review all elements carefully to ensure everything is accurate, complete, and compelling. This final review is your opportunity to make any necessary adjustments and ensure your campaign presents your situation in the best possible light.

Review your campaign title to ensure it accurately represents your situation and is likely to catch the attention of potential donors browsing campaigns. Consider whether the title clearly communicates the medical need and creates an emotional connection without being overly dramatic or misleading.

Read through your entire campaign story to check for clarity, accuracy, and emotional impact. Ensure that all important information is included and that the story flows logically from introduction through explanation of need to call for action. Check for any spelling or grammatical errors that might detract from the professionalism of your campaign.

Verify that your funding goal is appropriate and that you have clearly explained how the funds will be used. Donors want to know that their contributions will make a meaningful difference, so be specific about what different funding levels will accomplish and what happens if you exceed your goal.

Review all uploaded documents to ensure they support your campaign story and that verification badges are displayed correctly. If any documents are still pending verification, consider whether you want to wait for completion before publishing or proceed with publication and add verification badges as they become available.

Check your campaign settings including privacy options, update preferences, and contact information. Ensure that you are comfortable with the level of information sharing you have selected and that potential donors will be able to reach you if they have questions about your campaign.

Once you are satisfied with all aspects of your campaign, click the "Publish Campaign" button to make your campaign live on the SaveLife.com platform. Your campaign will immediately become visible to potential donors and will be included in search results and recommendation algorithms.

After publishing, you will receive a unique campaign URL that you can share with friends, family, and social networks to promote your fundraising effort. You will also receive access to campaign management tools that allow you to post updates, respond to donor messages, and track your fundraising progress.

## Donating to Campaigns

### Finding Campaigns to Support

SaveLife.com offers multiple ways to discover campaigns that align with your interests and giving preferences. Our AI-powered recommendation system learns from your browsing and donation history to suggest campaigns that are likely to resonate with you, while our search and filtering tools allow you to actively explore campaigns based on specific criteria.

The campaign discovery process begins on the platform homepage, which features a curated selection of campaigns that represent the diversity of medical needs supported by our community. These featured campaigns are selected based on factors including urgency of need, verification status, campaign quality, and potential for success with additional support.

To explore campaigns more systematically, use the "Browse Campaigns" feature, which provides access to all active campaigns on the platform. The browse interface includes powerful filtering options that allow you to narrow your search based on medical condition, geographic location, funding goal, campaign age, and verification status.

Our AI-powered personalized recommendations appear throughout the platform and are tailored to your interests and giving history. If you have previously donated to cancer-related campaigns, for example, you may see more recommendations for similar campaigns. These recommendations become more accurate over time as the system learns your preferences.

The search functionality allows you to find campaigns using keywords related to medical conditions, patient names, locations, or other relevant terms. Search results are ranked based on relevance to your query as well as factors like campaign quality and verification status to help you find the most trustworthy and compelling campaigns.

Each campaign listing includes key information to help you make informed decisions about where to direct your support. This includes the campaign title and brief description, current funding status and goal, verification badges indicating document authenticity, location information, and time since campaign creation. This information helps you quickly assess which campaigns align with your interests and giving criteria.

### Evaluating Campaign Credibility

One of the most important aspects of charitable giving is ensuring that your donations support legitimate needs and reach the intended recipients. SaveLife.com provides multiple tools and indicators to help you evaluate campaign credibility and make informed decisions about your charitable giving.

Our AI-powered verification system is the primary tool for assessing campaign authenticity. Campaigns that have undergone successful document verification display verification badges that indicate the types of documentation that have been reviewed and confirmed. These badges provide immediate visual confirmation that the campaign has been vetted for authenticity.

The verification process examines multiple aspects of each campaign including medical documentation authenticity, consistency between different documents, realistic cost estimates based on typical treatment expenses, and valid healthcare provider information. Campaigns that pass this comprehensive review receive trust scores that help donors assess credibility at a glance.

In addition to automated verification, our platform includes community features that allow donors to ask questions and receive responses from campaign creators. This direct communication helps build trust and allows you to get additional information about aspects of the campaign that are important to your giving decision.

Campaign updates provide ongoing evidence of authenticity and progress toward treatment goals. Legitimate campaigns typically include regular updates about treatment progress, how funds are being used, and expressions of gratitude to supporters. The frequency and quality of updates can be indicators of campaign legitimacy and creator engagement.

Social proof indicators including the number of donors, average donation size, and comments from other supporters can also help assess campaign credibility. Campaigns with broad support from multiple donors and positive feedback from the community are generally more trustworthy than campaigns with limited engagement.

If you have concerns about any campaign, our support team is available to investigate and provide additional information. We take campaign integrity seriously and investigate all reports of potentially fraudulent or misleading campaigns. Your vigilance as a donor helps maintain the integrity of our platform and protects the entire community.

### Making a Donation

The donation process on SaveLife.com is designed to be simple, secure, and transparent while providing you with options for how you want to support campaigns and interact with campaign creators and other donors.

To make a donation, navigate to the campaign you want to support and click the "Donate Now" button. This will open the donation interface, which guides you through the process of specifying your donation amount, payment method, and any additional preferences for your contribution.

You can choose from suggested donation amounts that are calibrated to the campaign's funding goal and typical donation patterns, or enter a custom amount that reflects your desired level of support. The donation interface shows you exactly how your contribution will impact the campaign's progress toward its funding goal.

Our platform supports multiple payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, and digital payment services like PayPal and Apple Pay. All payment processing uses industry-standard security protocols and encryption to protect your financial information. We never store complete payment information on our servers.

During the donation process, you have several options for personalizing your contribution. You can include a message of support that will be visible to the campaign creator and potentially other donors, depending on your privacy settings. You can also choose whether to make your donation publicly visible or anonymous.

If you prefer to remain anonymous, your name and donation amount will not be displayed publicly, though the campaign creator will still receive your message if you choose to include one. Anonymous donations still count toward campaign totals and help demonstrate community support for the cause.

After completing your donation, you will receive an immediate confirmation email with details about your contribution including the campaign name, donation amount, transaction ID, and tax receipt information. This email serves as your record of the donation for tax purposes and personal tracking.

You will also have the option to follow the campaign to receive updates about treatment progress and how your donation is making a difference. Following campaigns allows you to stay connected with the causes you support and see the long-term impact of your charitable giving.

### Donation Impact and Follow-up

Understanding the impact of your donation is an important part of the charitable giving experience, and SaveLife.com provides multiple ways to track how your contributions are making a difference in the lives of patients and families facing medical crises.

Immediately after making a donation, you can see how your contribution affects the campaign's progress toward its funding goal. The campaign page updates in real-time to reflect new donations, and you can see exactly how much closer your support brings the campaign to reaching its target.

Campaign creators are encouraged to post regular updates about treatment progress, how funds are being used, and expressions of gratitude to supporters. If you choose to follow campaigns you support, you will receive notifications when new updates are posted, allowing you to stay connected with the ongoing story.

Many campaign updates include specific information about how donations are being used, such as payments for specific treatments, medical equipment purchases, or coverage of travel expenses for treatment. This transparency helps you understand the direct impact of your contribution and builds confidence in the effectiveness of your charitable giving.

For campaigns that successfully reach their funding goals, you may receive updates about treatment outcomes and recovery progress. These success stories demonstrate the life-changing impact that charitable giving can have and provide inspiration for continued support of other campaigns.

Our platform also provides aggregate impact information that shows the collective effect of all donations made through SaveLife.com. This includes total funds raised, number of campaigns supported, and success stories from patients who have received life-saving treatments thanks to donor support.

If you have questions about how your donation is being used or want additional information about a campaign you have supported, you can contact campaign creators directly through our messaging system. Most campaign creators are eager to share information about their progress and express gratitude to their supporters.

Tax receipt information is provided for all donations to help you claim appropriate tax deductions for your charitable giving. Our platform generates the necessary documentation automatically, and you can access tax receipts through your donor dashboard at any time.

### Privacy and Security Settings

Protecting your privacy and maintaining account security are critical aspects of using any online platform, especially one that handles sensitive medical and financial information. SaveLife.com provides comprehensive privacy and security controls that allow you to customize your experience while maintaining appropriate protection.

Privacy settings control how your information is shared with other platform users and how it is used for platform features like donor matching and campaign recommendations. You can choose to make your donation history public or private, control whether your name appears on campaigns you support, and manage how your information is used for personalized recommendations.

Profile visibility settings allow you to control what information other users can see about you. This includes your name, location, donation history, and any biographical information you choose to share. You can make your profile completely private, selectively share information, or make everything public depending on your comfort level.

Communication preferences control how campaign creators and other users can contact you through the platform. You can choose to allow direct messages from anyone, limit messages to campaigns you have supported, or disable direct messaging entirely while still receiving important platform communications.

Security settings include options for enabling two-factor authentication, reviewing active login sessions, and managing connected devices. Two-factor authentication significantly improves account security and is strongly recommended for all users, especially those managing fundraising campaigns or making regular donations.

The help center is searchable and organized by topic, making it easy to find answers to specific questions quickly.

For issues that cannot be resolved through self-service resources, you can contact our support team directly through the platform's messaging system. Support requests are typically responded to within 24 hours, with urgent issues related to campaign verification or donation processing receiving priority attention.

Our support team includes specialists in different areas of platform functionality including campaign creation and optimization, donation processing and tax questions, technical issues and account management, and verification and trust and safety concerns.

### Best Practices for Success

Successful fundraising on SaveLife.com requires more than just creating a campaign and waiting for donations. The most successful campaigns combine compelling storytelling with active promotion, regular engagement with supporters, and strategic use of platform features to maximize reach and impact.

Campaign creation best practices include providing comprehensive and honest information about the medical situation, using high-quality photos that help donors connect with the patient's story, setting realistic funding goals based on actual treatment costs, and completing document verification to build donor trust. Taking time to craft a compelling and authentic story significantly improves campaign performance.

Promotion strategies that work well include sharing campaigns across multiple social media platforms, sending personalized messages to friends and family members, reaching out to relevant community groups and organizations, and leveraging local media coverage where appropriate. The most successful campaigns typically receive support from multiple channels rather than relying on a single promotion method.

Engagement with supporters is crucial for maintaining momentum and encouraging additional donations. This includes posting regular updates about treatment progress, responding promptly to donor questions and messages, expressing genuine gratitude for all levels of support, and sharing specific examples of how donations are making a difference.

Timing considerations can significantly impact campaign success. Launching campaigns early in the treatment process allows more time for fundraising, while posting updates and promotion during peak social media usage times can increase visibility. Understanding your audience's online behavior helps optimize the timing of campaign activities.

For donors, best practices include thoroughly researching campaigns before donating, starting with smaller donations to campaigns you are less familiar with, following up on campaigns you support to see the impact of your donations, and sharing worthy campaigns with your own networks to amplify their reach.

### Community Guidelines

SaveLife.com maintains community guidelines that ensure our platform remains a safe, supportive, and trustworthy environment for all users. These guidelines apply to all platform activities including campaign creation, donation activities, messaging, and community interactions.

Campaign content guidelines require that all campaigns represent legitimate medical needs with honest and accurate information. Campaigns must include sufficient detail for donors to understand the medical situation and funding need, use respectful language that maintains the dignity of patients and families, and avoid excessive emotional manipulation or misleading claims about treatment urgency or effectiveness.

Prohibited campaign content includes requests for non-medical expenses unless directly related to treatment, campaigns for experimental or unproven treatments without appropriate disclosure, requests for funding for illegal activities or substances, and campaigns that discriminate against individuals or groups based on protected characteristics.

Communication guidelines require that all interactions between users be respectful, helpful, and appropriate. This includes donor messages to campaign creators, campaign creator responses to supporters, and any community forum participation. Harassment, spam, or inappropriate content is not tolerated and may result in account suspension.

Privacy and confidentiality guidelines require that users respect the privacy of patients and families, even when campaigns are public. This includes not sharing personal information beyond what is provided in campaigns, respecting requests for privacy from campaign creators, and not using campaign information for purposes other than making informed donation decisions.

Verification and authenticity guidelines require that all campaign information be truthful and that any requested documentation be provided promptly and accurately. Attempts to circumvent verification processes or provide false information may result in campaign suspension and account termination.

Violation reporting mechanisms allow community members to report campaigns or user behavior that appears to violate community guidelines. All reports are investigated promptly, and appropriate action is taken to maintain platform integrity and user safety.
